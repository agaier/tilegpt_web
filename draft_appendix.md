## Open Source Code

Please see our [repo](https://github.com/agaier/tilegpt) for code release. Our
own experiments modify the [pyribs](https://pyribs.org/) library for MAP-Elites, the [Mario-GPT](https://github.com/shyamsn97/mario-gpt) code for the language model components, and the [DeBroglie](https://boristhebrave.github.io/DeBroglie/) WFC library.
